Hi App Reviewer Team,

Thank you for your detailed feedback. I have addressed all the issues mentioned in your email:

1. I have updated the screenshots to include a view of the storefront with the app's widget displayed as requested.
2. The app now includes detailed setup instructions for using the app embeds and app blocks. Users can access these instructions by clicking the "Guideline" link on the homepage of the app, which opens a modal with step-by-step guidance. Please see the attached image for reference.
3. I have also corrected the issue with the app block. The app block is now consistent with the demo, allowing merchants to add, reposition, and remove app blocks in the theme editor as expected.

Please let me know if there are any further adjustments needed.

Best regards,  

Alexandra
